This application is a tool to help you keep track of all of your holiday shopping. You can add gifts associated with friends and maintain an interactive list of presents you need to buy before the holidays.

## Breakdown

Users can create friends and gifts. The gifts belong to friends, and friends belong to users. The gifts that are associated with friends can be switched between the states purchased, or not purchased. The gifts can also be deleted from the list. Each friend has their own list of gifts.
